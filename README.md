### Specific releases per version of Mypal68:
As a clean is performed each major version published (68.13; 68.14; and so on), it is recommended to use a version of the language pack that is specifically made for the branch you use, or you can end with a partially untranslated UI due to old strings that got removed in newer revisions of the Language Pack.

Here you can find a table with the most recommended version to use for each version of Mypal68:
